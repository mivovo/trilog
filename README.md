# Trilog

I define my creative output as a balance between atmosphere design, building narratives and creating tools. This progressive webapp is my personal tracking tool. It works offline and syncs to _io.neufv.website_ whenever possible. I pick a point on the triangle to indicate the balance of today's creative output, which then gets assigned an RGB color. Atmosphere is red, Narrative is green and Tools is blue. The mixture of these colors is saved and visualized in a color bar at the bottom of the screen.

By logging every day, I hope to discover patterns in my creative process. By seeing how the balance shifts around, I might learn more about how I work. This is largely inspired by [Devine Lu Linvega](http://wiki.xxiivv.com) who tracks how many hours he spends on every creative task he performs in order to predict what he should work on next.
